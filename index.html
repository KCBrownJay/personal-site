            <p class="about">Hey there! My name is Josh Brown, but I typically go by JB. I'm an aspiring web developer
                that enjoys learning new things and solving problems. I began my journey of learning web development
                in college while majoring in Business, however, I really began to focus on web dev during the height of the 
                Corona Virus pandemic. I enjoy working on various projects using tools such as HTMl, CSS, and JavaScript, 
                along with frameworks such as vue.JS. I'm currently based in Springfield,MO where I work with a non-for-profit 
                organization called <a class="sgf" href="https://www.opensgf.org/" target="_blank">Open SGF</a>.</p>
